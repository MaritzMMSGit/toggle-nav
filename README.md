# Toggle Nav Demo

This demo demonstrates:

* using the CSS ancestor sibling selector
  to implement a hideable left nav area
* three features of LESS:
  variables, mixins, and nested rules.
* two features of AngularJS:
  ng-class and ng-click

There are three versions.

* index-css.html - uses CSS and JavaScript
* index-less.html - uses LESS and JavaScript
* index-ng.html - uses LESS and AngularJS, with no custom JavaScript

To run these, enter "node server.js" and
browse localhost:3000/index-{version}.html.
